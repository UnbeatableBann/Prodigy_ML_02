## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing and business strategy. By understanding different customer groups, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and increase sales. This project demonstrates how to use K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase history.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information and their purchase history. The dataset includes the following features:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-UnbeatableBann/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
    cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Ensure the dataset file (`Mall_Customers.csv`) is placed in the root directory of the project.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, apply the K-means clustering algorithm, and visualize the results.

## Results

The project outputs visualizations of the clustered customer segments, providing insights into distinct groups based on their purchase history. These insights can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
